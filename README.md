# AiDUCATION

AiDUCATION was created for RTC's Black Wings Hacks 2024 Hackathon. It aims to provide internet safety and security education to the youth through an online platform. Users can take a short quiz to assess their knowledge. They can also read about different topics to receive practical tips. Our project has a chatbot built with machine learning that assists in simulating good practices when talking to strangers online. Inspired by the rise of AI, we felt it was important to educate kids on how they can stay safe in a world where technology will continue to advance.

It was built using: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Flask, and Python.
