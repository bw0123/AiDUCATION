    <h1 class="text-center">Suspicious Links and URLS</h1>
        <p>Hello, young internet adventurers! Here is an important lesson about staying safe while exploring the vast world of the internet. Just like in the real world, there are some bad guys out there who try to deceive us with suspicious links or URLs. This can lead us to harmful websites or even scams. These websites may try to collect your personal information or install malicious software on your device. To protect yourself, follow these guidelines:</p>
        <div>
            <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    First and foremost, always think before you click. Pay close attention to the website address. Check for any misspellings, unusual characters, or extra numbers or symbols. These can be red flags indicating a potentially harmful link. 
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    Second, be cautious of shortened URLs, as they can hide the true destination of the link. If you're unsure, you can use a URL expander tool to reveal the full link before clicking on it. 
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    Third, be wary of unsolicited emails, messages, or pop-ups that contain links. Legitimate sources usually don't send unexpected messages with clickable links. 
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    Lastly, trust your instincts. If something feels off or too good to be true, it's better to err on the side of caution and avoid clicking on the link. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
